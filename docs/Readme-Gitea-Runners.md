## Run the act-runner (external container/runner) directly

```sh
# the Act runner config files are in _assets/
cd ./_assets/

# generate a config file
act_runner generate-config > ./gitea-runner/config/runner-config.yaml

# edit the file
# ...

# start act_runner with the new config file
sudo act_runner daemon --config ./runner-config.yaml
```

### Get the certificates from Traefik

To be able to push to the Gitea container registry, it's needed to access it via HTTPS (why❓❓), so the easiest way is to build the container using docker inside the act_runner container
<!-- - ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest -->
- ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:runner-latest

 My customized version actually, running the root user, built with the dockerfile `../fastapi-demo/runner-root.dockerfile`

- ghcr.io/kubernetista/runner-root:v2

This works and has been tested already, I'm able to build a container inside the local act runner, it still creates another container in docker, where the docker client actually runs and all the good stuff.

But I still need to add the certificates to be able to push to the Gitea Container Registry.

To make it work, follow the instructions:

- <https://forum.gitea.com/t/cannot-checkout-a-repository-hosted-on-a-gitea-instance-using-self-signed-certificate-server-certificate-verification-failed/7903>

```sh
#
kubectl get configmap kube-root-ca.crt -n traefik -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' > ca.crt
```

### Run the runner-root (internal container) with docker compose

```sh
cd _assets/
docker compose up
# docker compose up -d

```
