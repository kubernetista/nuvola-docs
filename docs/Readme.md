# Quick Start

You need Docker Desktop running.

## 1. Create a Kubernetes cluster

Create a Kubernetes cluster with k3d/k3s

```sh
# Create (with the config already created and updated)
cd nuvola

# Set it explicitly or loaded from direnv .envrc
# export K3D_CLUSTER="nuvola-1"
echo ${K3D_CLUSTER}

# Generate the k3d configuration (using a Just recipe)
just k3d-cluster-generate-config

# Create the k3d cluster
just k3d-cluster-create

```

## 2. Check ArgoCD deployment progress

To check the ArgoCD deployment progesess, open the ArgoCD web UI and login with user "admin" and the initial password (see below)

- [ArgoCD](http://argocd.localhost){: target="_blank" } : `http://argocd.localhost`

You can do the same using the CLI only:

```sh
# Watch pod creation, until ArgoCD is deployed
kubectl get pod -A -w

# Get the ArgoCD initial password
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd | head -n 1

# Login to ArgoCD
argocd login --insecure --grpc-web --username admin argocd.localtest.me

# Refresh the app-of-apps (to speed up the process)
argocd app get <appName> --hard-refresh

# Check progress
argocd app wait apps --health --sync

```

#### Wait until the git namespace is ready, then proceed creating the secrets

```sh
# Wait until the 'git' namespace exists
time until kubectl get namespace git >/dev/null 2>&1; do
  sleep 1
done
# Then create the required secrets
kubectl apply -f secrets/

```

## Certificate for HTTPS (using kixelated/mkcert)

!!! todo
    ☑️ TODO: replace the steps below with a container or a Dagger module ☑️

Generate a new TLS certificate with kixelated/mkcert, and add it tp Traefik.

The certificate will last 20 days (for security reasons) but you can adjust it.

!!! warning
    🛫 If you already have a valid certificate, for example because you already generated
    it following the steps below, then jump to [__step 4__](#4-install-the-certificates-and-reload-traefik) 🛫

## 3. Generate the certs

```sh
# Generate the certs with expiration in 20gg using kixelated/mkcert
cd kixelated-mkcert

# Generate
./mkcert -days=20 "*.localtest.me"

# Check
openssl x509 -in _wildcard.localtest.me.pem -noout -text | bat -l yaml

# Copy the files to the nuvola repo, in a directory excluded from git
cp _wildcard.localtest.me* ../_nuvola/nuvola/_assets/secrets/

# Switch to the directory containing the certs
cd nuvola/_assets/secrets

# Rename
CERT_NAME="wildcard-localtest-me"
mv _wildcard.localtest.me.pem  ${CERT_NAME}.pem
mv _wildcard.localtest.me-key.pem  ${CERT_NAME}-key.pem

# Generate kubernetes secret with the cert ${CERT_NAME}.pem
kubectl create -n default secret tls ${CERT_NAME}-tls \
    --cert=${CERT_NAME}.pem --key=${CERT_NAME}-key.pem \
    --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl neat > secret-tls-${CERT_NAME}.yaml
```

## 4. Install the certificates and reload Traefik

```sh
# Switch to the directory containing the certs
cd nuvola/_assets/secrets

# Create the secret containing the TLS certificate and its key
CERT_NAME="wildcard-localtest-me"
kubectl apply -f secret-tls-${CERT_NAME}.yaml

# Restart Traefik to load the new cert
# kubectl rollout restart deployment traefik -n traefik

```

Check ArgoCD with the TLS certificate:

- [ArgoCD](https://argocd.localtest.me){: target="_blank" } : `https://argocd.localtest.me`

## 5. Configure Vault and External Secrets

!!! info
    Vault is currently being configured in Development mode, so at every restart
    of the container the secrets and the configuration are reset to the default values.

    Therefore, the steps below will be required at every Docker Desktop or laptop restart.

Without configuring Vault and ExternalSecrets many features will be missing, so:

```sh
# Switch to the ExternalSecrets helm projext
cd external-secrets-helm

# Wait for vault to be ready
kubectl wait -n vault --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=vault

# Run the setup script using Just
just setup-vault-eso-test-app
```

## 6. Push a local repo to git and start building

Using a Just recipe, push the Nuvola git repository to Gitea running on Nuvola

```sh
# Push to git creating the repo as public
just git-push-local
```

This step is not required, it's just to show how easy it is to get started with
your next project.

## 🎉 Configuration completed

Congratulations, your Nuvola is ready! ☁️

Explore the [documentation home](/) to discover the full range of tools Nuvola offers.

__☁️ Enjoy!__

## Troubleshooting

If some resources are unavailable wia the browser, it could be due to Traefik: restart it.

```sh
# Restart Traefik
kubectl rollout restart deployment traefik -n traefik
```
